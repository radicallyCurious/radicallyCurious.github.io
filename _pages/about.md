## A Life of Service
--------------------
In 2017, Luc became a New York State EMT working in New York City, and that's when it all began. He moved on to being a field training officer (FTO) with his first Emergency Medical Services (EMS) agency. In 2018, Luc enlisted in the New York Army National Guard as a combat medic. He spent a year away from home training to become the best lifesaver he could become, graduating at the top of his class. Upon his return home, Luc worked in EMS agenices that allowed him to serve patient populations in Lower Manhattan, the South Bronx, Downtown Brooklyn, East New York, Harlem, and Washington Heights. Come December of 2021, Luc entered the NYPD Police Academy. In his short time as a police officer, he received multiple recognitions and works to serve the the communities of NYC through enforcement and community policing.

During his professional career, teaching was always an underpinning. Before becoming an EMT, Luc worked at a STEM education center on the upper west side of Manhattan for almost four years designing curriculum, teaching professional development for NYC teachers, and instructing K through 12 in physics, engineering, and robotics. In 2019, Luc spent a year as an instructor at CUNY Baruch's CAPS program teaching Java, Python, and data sciene to adult learners. In 2020, he became an EMT instructor teaching those wishing to become EMTs the necessary psychomotor skills at a standard set to surpass the standard of NYS EMT testing as well as giving lectures in basic anatomy, physiology, pathophysiology, prehospital medicine and EMS operations. Also in 2020, Luc also became his field artillery battalion's unofficial official Combat Lifesaver Instructor which entailed teaching soldiers the basics of treating lifesaving wounds to help treat the most preventable causes of death on the battlefield.

Luc has a strong passion for helping those who help others. At the peak of his academic studies he hopes to be able to primarily treat first responders dealing with PTSD, substance abuse, anxiety, and depression. As well, Luc has research interests in neuroscience, cognitive science, and psychology dealing with PTSD, substance abuse, childhood abuse and maltreatment, stigma/bias in law enforcement, and other niche areas in the forensic world.
