# A Life of Service
--
In 2017, Luc became a New York State EMT working in New York City. He quickly moved on to being a field training officer (FTO) with his first Emergency Medical Services (EMS) agency. In 2018, Luc enlisted in the New York Army National Guard as a combat medic. He spent a year away from home training to become the best lifesaver he could become, graduating at the top of his class. 

Upon return home, Luc became an EMT instructor and worked in the NYC EMS 911 system responding to calls for service for EMS and serving patient populations in Lower Manhattan, the South Bronx, Downtown Brooklyn, East New York, Harlem, and Washington Heights. 

Come December of 2021, Luc entered the NYPD Police Academy and graduated at the top of his class while serving as a company sergeant during the academy. In his short time as a police officer, he received multiple recognitions for performing his duties and was appointed to special operations teams within his precinct.

During his professional career, teaching was always an underpinning. Prior to becoming an EMT, Luc worked at a STEM education center on the upper west side as an educator for almost four years. In 2019, Luc spent a year as instructor at CUNY Baruch's CAPS program teaching Java, Python, and data sciene to adult learners. In 2020, he became an EMT instructor teaching those wishing to become EMTs the necessary psychomotor skills at a standard set to surpass the standard of NYS EMT testing as well giving lectures in basic anatomy, physiology, pathophysiology, and EMS operations. Also in 2020, Luc also became his field artillery battalion's unofficial official Combat Lifesaver Instructor which entailed teaching soldiers the basics of treating lifesaving wounds to help treat the most preventable causes of death on the battlefield.
